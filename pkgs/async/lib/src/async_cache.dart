/// Runs asynchronous functions and caches the result for a period of time.

/// This class exists to cover the pattern of having potentially expensive code
/// such as file I/O, network access, or isolate computation that's unlikely to
/// change quickly run fewer times. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// final _usersCache = new AsyncCache<List<String>>(const Duration(hours: 1));
///
/// /// Uses the cache if it exists, otherwise calls the closure:
/// Future<List<String>> get onlineUsers => _usersCache.fetch(() {
///   // Actually fetch online users here.
/// });
/// ```
///
/// This class's timing can be mocked using
/// [`fake_async`](https://pub.dev/packages/fake_async).
