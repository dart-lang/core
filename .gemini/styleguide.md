# The dart-lang Dart style guide

## Introduction

This style guide outlines the coding conventions for Dart code contributed to
dart-lang repositories. All Dart code should follow the Effective Dart style
guide (https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style).

## Contribution Guidelines

- larger or significant changes should be discussed in an issue before creating
  a PR
- contributions to our repos should follow the Dart style guide and use 'dart
  format'
- most changes should add an entry to the changelog and may need to rev the
  pubspec package version
- changes to packages require corresponding tests
